Test branch for decryption

Unofficial TWRP for Oppo A91 (CPH2021) running Android 11.\
This recovery should work also on the Oppo F15 (CPH2001) as it's a rebranded A91.

### Specifications

### Working
- ADB

<hr>

### Installation
Since this phone has fastboot disabled it is necessary to use alternative tools. I recommend using [MTKClient](https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient). \
Just unzip the file and flash the TWRP to the recovery partition.
